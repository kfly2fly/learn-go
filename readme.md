# Keenan's Go Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of command-line applications built while learning the Go programming language. The project served as my hands-on playground for exploring Go fundamentals and best practices. Most of these projects follow the tutorials by Maximilian Schwarzmuller on Udemy.

## Project Overview

This project helped me become proficient with Go programming and its ecosystem. Each sub-project implements different aspects of the language to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

The repository demonstrates:

- Core Go language features and syntax
- Command-line application development
- Concurrent programming with goroutines and channels
- Error handling
- Package organization and module management
- Standard library exploration

## Installation

Ensure you have Go installed on your system (version 1.16+ recommended).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kfly2fly/learn-go.git

# Build all programs
go build ./...

# Run a specific program
go run price_calculator/main.go

```
